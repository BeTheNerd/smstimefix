       Use this tool to fix any messages that were received prior to using SMS Time Fix. Set a start date and end date that includes the messages that you want adjusted.
       \n\nPlease make sure that you have backed up all of your messages before running this tool! If your battery dies, or the app crashes, or you have misconfigured the tool, there is no easy way to undo. Pick any of the SMS backup tools in the Play Store and back them up!
       \n\nNote that for some devices, the time of affected conversations will be incorrectly updated to the current time. The individual messages will be correct, but the conversation/thread time will not. i.e. In the main SMS app where it shows a snippet of all of your conversations, the last updated time will be incorrect. After selecting a conversation, all of the individual messages inside will have the correct time. This will be fixed once a new message is sent/received for a conversation.
